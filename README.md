# news

> an incredibly simple, customised news website, built for myself. It uses News API as the core, and Vue to deliver the content. It was built for the purposes of my article, which can be found here - 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
